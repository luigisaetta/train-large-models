This repo contains all the work for the **DevLive Level Upâ€“Italy, 11 september 2023**.

In the event two main subjects are covered:

* How to train **Large Models** using OCI Data Science, JOBS and GPU

## Samples
* [How to create and launch a JOB using ADS](./launch_jobs_italian.ipynb)
* [How to train using the command line](./train_nb.sh)

The example used in the workshop is based on the training of OpenAI Whisper on the ATCO2 dataset.
